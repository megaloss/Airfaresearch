# FLEXIFLY

This is a web application, built using Python FastAPI. 
The idea is to help user find the best return flight in terms of price / stay duration.
So far it collects data from Ryanair, Transavia and Easyjet web-sites. 
You choose departing and returning date periods, then departing airport on the map. 
Wait till the data collected and available flights showed on map. THen you can filter the data by price range.
If you click on a destination marker you can see flight info.
